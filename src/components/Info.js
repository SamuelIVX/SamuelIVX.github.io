                    Back in 2021, I decided to make a life changing decision to focus on Computer Science rather than art.
                    Since then, I have entered a wormhole of <strong style={{ color: "orange" }}>software engineering and web development</strong>, and I have loved every second of it.
                    I have had the privilege to work for many companies such as <strong style={{ color: "orange" }}>Amazon</strong>, as an AFE SDE Intern as part of the AWS team.

                    My main focus these days is too <strong style={{ color: "orange" }}>learn and create</strong> as much as possible. I mostly enjoying building websites and other
                    personal projects to display what I have learnt throughout these past couple of years.

                    When I am not staring at my computer for hours on end, I like to play soccer, watch anime (and collect/read manga),
                    hanging out with family and friends, as well with my 2 cats, or playing video games.
